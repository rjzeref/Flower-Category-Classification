# üå∏ Image-Based Dimension Extraction and Flower Classification using SFFFP Neural Network

## üöÄ Overview  
This project presents a novel approach to automate flower species identification and classification, focusing on tri-petal flowers like **Iris**. Leveraging **deep learning** with a **Sequential Fast Forward Feed Perceptron (SFFFP)** neural network, this method overcomes traditional challenges like manual feature extraction and dataset limitations. Achieving an impressive **96.67% precision accuracy**, the proposed system paves the way for robust and scalable image-based plant identification solutions.

## üß† Key Features  
- **Automated Dimension Extraction**: Measures sepal and petal dimensions from images using lightweight segmentation techniques.  
- **Real-World Scalability**: Converts pixel measurements to real-world dimensions (cm) through external calibration.  
- **High-Accuracy Classification**: Utilizes SFFFP for precise classification of Iris species (`Iris setosa`, `Iris versicolor`, `Iris virginica`).  
- **Minimal Preprocessing**: Eliminates the need for pre-measured datasets or manual feature extraction.

## üìÇ Dataset  
- Dataset used: [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/).  
- Preprocessing includes:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Train-test split (80%-20%) for robust evaluation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
1. **Image Segmentation**  
   - Extract the flower from the background using lightweight processing techniques.  
   - RGB channel decomposition and emphasis on the **Blue Plane** for improved visibility.  

2. **Dimension Calculation**  
   - Extract pixel measurements for sepals and petals.  
   - Apply scaling factors to derive real-world dimensions.  

3. **Classification**  
   - Input dimensions into the **SFFFP Neural Network**.  
   - Train the model with 150 epochs for optimal performance.
